# Hello, my name is Janine

## About Me  
I am an undergraduate student at Hokkaido University. I enjoy studying the Japanese language, its history and its modern use. However, my primary focus is on Japanese society, having recently finished a project study about marriage-hunting culture in Japan. I am generally interested in various causes of the population decline and the wider societal implications.

## Future Endeavours
I should come up with my Bachelor's thesis topic as soon as possible, but I didn't expect finding my calling to be so difficult. If possible, that same field would be connected to my Master's thesis, so a lot is at stake.
